# Diffusion-models-for-single-cell-gene-expression-data
We train a denoising diffusion probabilistic model on single-cell RNA-seq data (PBMC3k) to learn a generative model of gene-expression states, and show that generated cells recover realistic cell-type structure and marker-gene profiles.
# 🧬 Dataset: PBMC3k
PBMC3k is a widely used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset generated by 10x Genomics, consisting of approximately 3,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected from a healthy human donor.

PBMCs are a mixture of immune cell populations—including T cells, B cells, NK cells, and monocytes—which naturally form well-defined clusters in gene-expression space. This makes PBMC3k an ideal benchmark for generative modeling tasks such as denoising, latent representation learning, and synthetic cell generation.
